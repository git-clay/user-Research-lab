# User Research Lab

The website I decided to research was [triphobo](http://www.triphobo.com/). This website uses a few api's such as trip advisor and google maps.  I picked this website because it is closer to what I would like to create for project three in the sense that it is the full package from initial ideas to the fine details.  

However, this website feels very busy and complicated.  I would like to create a simplified version while still providing the same information. I aslo feel like these websites neglect a large portion of the population.  The people that do not like an exact schedule or people that prefer outdoors adventures instead of city tourist attractions.

In my user research, I started to see some trends in the very small sample size I tested.  Navigation buttons from page to page took some coaching to get through on the people I interviewed because the pages were so busy. Everyone really liked the days to day schdule breakdown along with cost being displayed instantly instead of having to dig for it.
